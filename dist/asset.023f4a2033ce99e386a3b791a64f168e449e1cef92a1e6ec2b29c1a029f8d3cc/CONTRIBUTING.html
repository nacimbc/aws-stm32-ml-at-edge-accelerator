<h1 id="contributing-guidelines">Contributing Guidelines</h1>
<p>Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. Whether
it’s a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional documentation,
we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.</p>
<p>Please read through this document before submitting any issues or
pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary information to
effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.</p>
<h2 id="reporting-bugsfeature-requests">Reporting Bugs/Feature
Requests</h2>
<p>We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or
suggest features.</p>
<p>When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed,
issues to make sure somebody else hasn’t already reported the issue.
Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these
are incredibly useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>A reproducible test case or series of steps</li>
<li>The version of our code being used</li>
<li>Any modifications you’ve made relevant to the bug</li>
<li>Anything unusual about your environment or deployment</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="contributing-via-pull-requests">Contributing via Pull
Requests</h2>
<p>Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending
us a pull request, please ensure that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You are working against the latest source on the <em>main</em>
branch.</li>
<li>You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make
sure someone else hasn’t addressed the problem already.</li>
<li>You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate
for your time to be wasted.</li>
</ol>
<p>To send us a pull request, please:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Fork the repository.</li>
<li>Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are
contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us
to focus on your change.</li>
<li>Ensure local tests pass.</li>
<li>Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.</li>
<li>Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull
request interface.</li>
<li>Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull
request, and stay involved in the conversation.</li>
</ol>
<p>GitHub provides additional document on <a
href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">forking a
repository</a> and <a
href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/">creating
a pull request</a>.</p>
<h2 id="finding-contributions-to-work-on">Finding contributions to work
on</h2>
<p>Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to
contribute on. As our projects, by default, use the default GitHub issue
labels (enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix),
looking at any ‘help wanted’ issues is a great place to start.</p>
<h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>This project has adopted the <a
href="https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct">Amazon Open Source Code of
Conduct</a>. For more information see the <a
href="https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct-faq">Code of Conduct FAQ</a>
or contact opensource-codeofconduct@amazon.com with any additional
questions or comments.</p>
<h2 id="security-issue-notifications">Security issue notifications</h2>
<p>If you discover a potential security issue in this project we ask
that you notify AWS/Amazon Security via our <a
href="http://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/">vulnerability
reporting page</a>. Please do <strong>not</strong> create a public
github issue.</p>
<h2 id="licensing">Licensing</h2>
<p>See the <a href="LICENSE">LICENSE</a> file for our project’s
licensing. We will ask you to confirm the licensing of your
contribution.</p>
